*actions*  this addon provides a list of actions which can be mapped to keys

HOWTO~

Example usage adding an action running make: >

  call actions#AddAction("run make",{'buffer':'<buffer>', 'action':'make')
<
  more advanced example which does some lazy configuring: >
  call actions#AddAction("run make",{'buffer':'<buffer>', 'action': funcref#Function('return "make -f ".FindMakeFile()') })
<

  Then you press <s-F2> to assign an action to the f2 key. Have a look at the
  default key assignments in plugin/actions.vim

  You can also use >
  SetActionOnWrite
< to run an action whenever you write a buffer. (Also see 'autowrite')

  If you want to run multiple commands in order return a list of strings.
  They'll be joined by "<bar>". So use exec "your command" if it doesn't support
  bang

  TIP: You can use the vim-addon-backrgound-cmd to run compilations or tagging
  commands in background!

CUSTOMIZATION~

  You can override the default mappings. This example will let you use \a to
  assign a mapping to <c-a>: >
  let g:vim_actions = {}
  let g:vim_actions['bindable_keys'] = [ ['\a', '<c-a>'] ]
<
