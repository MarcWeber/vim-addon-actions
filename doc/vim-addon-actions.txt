HOWTO~

Example usage adding an action running make: >

  call actions#AddAction("run make",{'buffer':'<buffer>', 'action':'make')
<
  more advanced example which does some lazy configuring: >
  call actions#AddAction("run make",{'buffer':'<buffer>', 'action': funcref#Function('return "make -f ".FindMakeFile()') })
<

  You can use the vim-addon-backrgound-cmd to run compilations or tagging
  commands in background!

  If you want to run multiple commands in order return a list of strings.
  They'll be joined by "<bar>". So use exec "your command" if it doesn't support
  bang
